Dataset:
Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components
  

*Preprocessing Steps:*

1. Loaded breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
2. Scaled features using StandardScaler to have zero mean and unit variance.

*Justification:*

- Handling missing values: The breast cancer dataset has no missing values.
- Feature scaling: Necessary for algorithms like SVM and Logistic Regression.


*Classification Algorithm Descriptions:*

1. Logistic Regression: Linear model for binary classification.
2. Decision Tree Classifier: Tree-based model for classification.
3. Random Forest Classifier: Ensemble of decision trees for classification.
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Linear or nonlinear model for classification.
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Distance-based model for classification.


*Model Comparison:*

- Compared accuracy scores of the five classification algorithms.
- Identified best and worst performing algorithms
